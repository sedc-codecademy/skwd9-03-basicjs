Coin donimination problem:

We need to write a javascript program so we can calcucalte the amout of coins we need to have in order to buy a specific product in coins.
We are given certain amount of cents in coins and we need to calculate how many of each coin we will need to buy a specific product.
Take in count that we need to use as less coins as possible.

Example:
We have 263 cents and we have certain amount of coins with the following denomination:
 - 7, 50 cents coins
 - 10, 10 cents coins
 - 17, 5 cents coins
 - 23, 2 cents coins
 - 30, 1 cent coin

To cover the amount of 263 cents we will need at least 8 coins.
Those coins will be 5 - 50 cents coins, 1 - 10 cents coin, 1 - 2 cents coin and 1 - 1 cent coin.

Make this task work dynamicly with user input. (It does not matter if you want to make it work with input field or prompt up to you).

We can use only natural numbers for the input for cents.
