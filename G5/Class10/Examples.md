### Exercise 1
SEDC wants to hire you as developers for a simple login feature implementation. The goal is to validate a user by its username and password. Make sure to display the user appropriate message if he/she tries to submit an empty value for some of the required inputs. If the user is logged in successfully then display him an appropriate welcome message. Make sure that you implement a function for solving this issue. 
##### Example input => Username: Bob / Password: noidea!232
##### Example output => Welcome #userName#! How are you today?
