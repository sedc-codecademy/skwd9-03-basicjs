# I learned the basics of JS  ðŸ’ª

### Exercise 1
SEDC wants to hire you as developers for a simple login feature implementation. The goal is to validate a user by its username and password. Make sure to display the user appropriate message if he/she tries to submit an empty value for some of the required inputs. If the user is logged in successfully then display him an appropriate welcome message. Make sure that you implement a function for solving this issue. 
##### Example input => Username: Bob / Password: noidea!232
##### Example output => Welcome #userName#! How are you today?

### Exercise 2 
Well done! SEDC is very satisfied with your implementation. So they have another request for you! Everything is fine up to the welcome message, but now they need to to display all the courses if a trainer is logged in, all the homeworks if an assistant is logged in and if a manager is logged in display message that this feature is in progress. This needs to be implemented again as a function.
##### Example input => Role: trainer | Role: assistant
##### Example output => Here are your courses: BJS, AJS, BasicC# | Here are all the homeworks: HW1, HW2....
