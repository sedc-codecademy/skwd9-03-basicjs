# I learned the basics of JS  ðŸ’ª

### Exercise 1
SEDC wants to hire you as developers for a simple login feature implementation. The goal is to validate a user by its username and password. Make sure to display the user appropriate message if he/she tries to submit an empty value for some of the required inputs. If the user is logged in successfully then display him an appropriate welcome message. Make sure that you implement a function for solving this issue. 
##### Example input => Username: Bob / Password: noidea!232
##### Example output => Welcome #userName#! How are you today?

### Exercise 2 
Well done! SEDC is very satisfied with your implementation. So they have another request for you! Everything is fine up to the welcome message, but now they need to to display all the courses if a trainer is logged in, all the homeworks if an assistant is logged in and if a manager is logged in display message that this feature is in progress. This needs to be implemented again as a function.
##### Example input => Role: trainer | Role: assistant
##### Example output => Here are your courses: BJS, AJS, BasicC# | Here are all the homeworks: HW1, HW2....


### Exercise 3
Great job! Now since you are such great devs, another company heard for your good work and want collaboration! They have an HR management software that will need some features. They have a databse with employees, but only the database administrator can manipulate with them directly in the DB. So the requirement is to allow them to see all their users and display them in the console. They keep the following info for each user: firstName, lastName and sector. Take into consideration that they have migrate recently from their old database to the new one, but they still use the both of them until full migration of the data. Since you become famous by using functions keep the good work! 
##### Example input => oldUsers | migratedUsers
##### Example output => 1. Bob 2.Mark 3.John | 1.Jane 2.Jack 3.Mickey

### Exercise 4
Lucky you, the company wants you for another implementation! Now the problem is that the number of users is growing and they have difficulties in searching for a particullar user. So the requirement is implementing a search functionality in their system. So based on a inserted name, we want to display the user if it is in the databse. 
##### Example input => Bob
##### Example output => 1. Bob
